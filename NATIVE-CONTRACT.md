# Native macOS integration contract

Status: active investigation, 2026-10-28. Current hardware stability is not
established. Offline checks do not establish a working network interface.

## Evidence and scope

Analyze the system modules actually loaded on this machine, rather than assume
that an older third-party adapter header describes the complete current ABI.

| Component | Matching local image UUID | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| XNU kernel, Sequoia 24G90 | E999BA1A-CC26-3685-A2DB-AB7085F6F12A | IOService provider inheritance and termination |
| IO80211Family | 0D5AC570-04D4-38B6-8577-9F21350CDD50 | WCL clients, commands, scans, association and messages |
| IOSkywalkFamily | 50C44C84-1166-387F-8ECE-02E931E2405B | Interface/data-path integration |

Local images were extracted as analysis containers from BootKernelExtensions.kc.
No Apple binary or raw private stackshot is committed. The current environment
provides LLVM disassembly, not an installed C decompiler. The pseudocode below is
manually reconstructed from matching assembly and is not recovered Apple source.
The local kernel collections contain the two listed networking families; no
separate Broadcom Wi-Fi module has yet been identified in those collections.

## Reconstructed provider and termination contract

Relevant Sequoia assembly entry points:

* `IOService::getWorkLoop` at standalone `0xffffff80009ddaa0` (linked cache `0xffffff8000ac5aa0`) obtains `getProvider()`,
  then tail-calls that provider's virtual `getWorkLoop()`; null provider returns
  null. This also matches the local SDK's documented provider-chain inheritance.
* `IO80211SkywalkInterface::newUserClient` at `0xffffff80022627c6` allocates an
  IO80211APIUserClient for type zero, initializes it, and attaches/starts it with
  the Skywalk interface as provider. Unsupported client types are rejected.
* `IO80211APIUserClient::stop` at `0xffffff80022c65a6` invokes stopGated directly
  when already in the appropriate queue, otherwise synchronously routes a block
  through its WCL workloop. It does not make holding an unrelated radio gate safe.
* `IO80211Controller::getWorkLoop` at `0xffffff800222b028` dispatches through a
  separate virtual workqueue accessor. Our BSD controller override intentionally
  differs because legacy IONetworkController paths need a threaded workloop.

```text
IOService.getWorkLoop():
    provider = getProvider()
    return provider ? provider.getWorkLoop() : null

nativeWifiInterface.getWorkLoop():
    return controller.getWorkQueue()       # WCL queue

nativeBSDInterface.getWorkLoop():
    return controller.getWorkLoop()        # threaded radio/BSD queue

notificationWorker():
    try WCL gate
        try radio gate
            publish queued native events
    if contention: retry later without holding either gate
```

The 04:30:37 watchdog identifies the radio/WCL inversion through API-client
termination and an airportd request. Giving the Wi-Fi provider the WCL queue
removes the inherited radio gate from that termination route. The BSD interface
also needs an explicit override because its public provider becomes the Wi-Fi
protocol after attachment. This candidate still requires hardware validation.

## Work and validation matrix

| Priority | Path | Evidence/status | Completion condition |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| P0 | Registration ownership | Candidate uses the stock typed factory, a borrowed Network prefix and cleanup hooks; host ownership and parent-vtable checks pass | Hardware stop/recovery retains one owner and no stale borrower |
| P0 | Event delivery errors | Candidate checks enqueue returns, keeps phase/cursors and retries with 10 ms backoff; host injection covers every stage | Verify system behavior during scan, rekey and failures on hardware |
| P0 | Provider queues and API client close | New provider overrides; existing nonblocking event bridge | No cyclic waits during repeated query/close/scan; useful traffic continues |
| P0 | Current BSS reply | Fixed scratch lifetime after WCL's confirmed Update Bss fail | Repeated background scans retain correct AP reply and connection |
| P0 | Data path after authorization | Last boot had authorized port but no DHCP and stalled worker | DHCP, ARP, IPv4, IPv6 and bound HTTPS pass while worker advances |
| P1 | Scan request semantics | Candidate passes requested physical channel subset to firmware; rejects empty regulatory intersection; pre-submit cancellation completes locally | Hardware confirms subset timing, SSID matching, cancel and completion ordering |
| P1 | Autojoin | About 32 seconds after login on previous boot | Trace and reduce avoidable retries without router changes |
| P1 | Visibility | Beacon metadata adjusted; saved profile still has Hidden=true | Compare fresh beacon, WCL current BSS and saved profile/UI independently |
| P1 | Join and keys | PSK/SHA256 fixtures and first traffic previously passed | Initial/rekey/abort/failure paths retain ordering and replay protections |
| P1 | Power and lifecycle | Candidate startup/stop barriers, power-blocked native admission and immediate security cleanup; automatic wake recovery missing | Off/on, sleep/wake and teardown have finite completion and safe DMA ownership |
| P2 | Queries and capabilities | 190 inline callbacks: 29 forward, 161 reject | Classify every rejection by actual system caller; implement mandatory contracts |
| P2 | IPv6/multicast and statistics | Partial implementation | Multicast filter and counters reflect delivered traffic; no fabricated metrics |
| P2 | WPA3/PMF | SAE and mandatory PMF/BIP not implemented | Implement and test complete authentication/protection, not an AKM label change |
| P3 | macOS 11–26 | Current adapter is Darwin 24 only | Versioned adapters with per-version ABI and hardware validation |
| P3 | AWDL/AirDrop | Planned only | AWDL interface/scheduling/IPv6 and Bluetooth integration validated |

For each required callback, record input layout and bounds, caller queue,
permitted state, action ownership, result/error semantics, event ordering,
timeout/cancellation, teardown dependencies, and independent test evidence.
An Unsupported response is not automatically a bug; a Success response without
the promised operation is not an acceptable replacement.

## Delivery gates

Run relevant production-method/packet tests, sanitizers, native build/import and
signature checks, then offline kernel linking. Preserve the candidate, source
revision and previous installed version with verified SD copies. Keep development
on `native-sequoia-development`. Do not modify the OS/root volume or manually
load the experimental kext. Reboots require explicit user authorization.


## Confirmed message-buffer ownership

`IO80211PostOffice::sendMail` at `0xffffff80022b261e` allocates `length+0x38`,
copies the caller payload into that allocation, then appends it to an intrusive
queue without acquiring a workloop gate itself. Thus stack payloads are copied
before return, but the caller must serialize PostOffice access. The boolean
argument is stored with the message; it is not a choice to borrow the payload.
Allocation failure returns `0xe00002bd` (NoMemory). The event-delivery candidate
checks this return and commits only the accepted phase. This proves enqueue
acceptance, not that WCL has already processed the asynchronous notification.
Hardware verification remains required.

The last pre-hang WCL log also records rejected FW_HOT_CHANNELS (424),
SET_ROAM_LOCK (428) and QOS_PARAMS (443). The join proceeded past these responses,
so this log alone does not make them the cause of the recorded lock inversion.
Their actual semantics/callers must be reviewed before adding success responses.

## Scan subset candidate

A native channel bitmap now becomes a mask over the physical plan, then
intersects the regulatory scan policy before START_SCAN is serialized. Duplicate
channels collapse; unrecognized/6 GHz channels cannot alias supported 2.4 GHz
channels. Empty intersections return Unsupported before starting firmware work.
Legacy/unrestricted scans keep the full regulatory plan. Requested SSID/BSSID
matching still filters delivered results; this change does not add active probes
or claim full hidden-network discovery.

The host suite covers native decode through firmware TLVs (literal 2437/5260 MHz
expectations, lengths, DFS passive policy, US channel-13 rejection and connected
home-rest timing), exact-capacity guards, and extracted production getters for
both provider workloops. The mocked radio suite exercises the real scan method's
pre-submit cancellation without DMA, START_SCAN or firmware credits, plus existing
STARTED/COMPLETED/STOP and stale-generation failure cases. Hardware timing and
stability on this candidate remain unverified.


## Notification acceptance, failure and ordering candidate

Security processing runs before the notification emitter. An allocation error
therefore cannot skip supplicant processing merely because an earlier event was
not accepted. The emitter stops attempting later messages in that pass after
any failed enqueue; the existing coalesced worker retries after 10 ms. It does
not enter a tight retry loop or add an unbounded private message queue. Stopping
cancels and waits for the same ONCE thread call, including delayed retries.

Separate phase markers track ResetInterface/DriverAvailable, scan-result cursor
and count, association, current-BSS scan result, link-up and first beacon,
ConnectComplete, abort completion, and Deauth/link-down. An accepted prefix is
not repeated after a later allocation failure. The old BSSID survives radio
state cleanup until both disconnect notifications have been accepted. New
MAC/scan/join transactions wait for pending abort/link-down events. Current BSS
availability follows real associated beacon data, not whether FirstBeacon has
already been enqueued successfully.

A hard join deadline takes precedence over success. Its cleanup closes the data
port and cancels the attempt once, even if the failure notification cannot yet
be allocated. Connection-event metadata remains available for the retry. A
healthy group/pair key replacement temporarily closes the controlled port; the
emitter preserves the existing link while associated and in a known rekey, and
still tears down on a real cancel/disconnect. These were source-level defects;
no claim is made that every previous hardware disconnect had either cause.

Host regressions execute the exact production emitter with a failing PostOffice
seam: repeated failure at each of 11 ordered boot/scan/join/RSSI messages,
byte-for-byte accepted payload comparison, scan cancellation during retry,
inactive-radio abort retry, failure at either disconnect message after radio
state reset, partial-link failed join, persistent allocation pressure, and hard
deadline cleanup. Bridge tests check retry coalescing and stop cancellation.
Full controller teardown and automatic wake/restart remain separate audit work;
this acceptance test does not prove the absence of all kernel lock cycles.


### Control-worker teardown ordering (2026-10-28)

The deferred probe can create the native interface and service thread call while cancellation waits for it. Both stop() and partial-initialization free() now drain that producer first, then stop/drain native requests, before releasing power notifications, runtime, IRQ or DMA resources. This closes late-worker creation after cancellation and access to already released radio resources. A host test executes the production drain helper with an in-flight producer; source guards check both resource-release call sites. Full host tests, ASan/UBSan and the native build pass. This is an offline candidate, not a verified fix for the observed hardware freeze.

Wake remains incomplete: the current power path blocks I/O after wake pending a full restart, and sleep notification registration happens after deferred firmware initialization. Automatic native recovery must coordinate in-progress initialization, sleep acknowledgement, DMA quiescence and provider rematch; simply clearing the block or replaying notifications is unsafe. No automatic recovery is claimed here.


### Sleep during initialization: barrier and ordering (2026-10-28)

This candidate supersedes the late-notifier-registration gap described above. The priority root sleep notifier is now registered before the deferred firmware/DMA producer is queued. A dedicated initialization mutex covers firmware probing and interface construction. The sleep/off path first raises the atomic I/O block, then waits for this producer barrier, and only then enters the radio workloop to quiesce the device. A producer which starts after the block is raised exits without booting firmware. Before WMI has a workloop, the power action uses the already-created controller workloop. Controller PM registration runs after releasing the initialization barrier, and runtime timer/IRQ startup rejects a pending power block. The mutex remains alive through base-controller destruction, after notifier removal, PMstop and worker draining.

The first suspend verifies bootstrap/runtime DMA release even when WMI never became active, retaining quarantine on failure. Repeated root/device suspend notices do not repeat PCI accesses after the first quiescence. DeviceOn or unsolicited wake before the pending suspend action records its state must not clear the atomic block: that case remains `suspend-pending`. An ordinary wake following a recorded suspend still requires a clean restart; automatic rematch is not implemented by this change.

Host tests execute the production power methods with real host threads and a mutex: a sleep callback raises the I/O block immediately, cannot acknowledge while initialization owns the barrier, and acknowledges after the producer leaves and the fallback controller gate verifies DMA. They also cover pending-suspend/DeviceOn ordering, partial-bootstrap quarantine, repeated notices, device/root wake ordering and cancelled sleep. Initialization and destruction boundaries are source guards, not an execution of the full kernel firmware probe. Physical sleep and freedom from all framework lock cycles remain unverified.

Framework evidence: the installed IO80211Family `IO80211SkywalkInterface::start` (UUID 0D5AC570-04D4-38B6-8577-9F21350CDD50, entry ffffff80022616d6) performs interface PM setup at ffffff8002261bb0–ffffff8002261bfa. Therefore interface construction itself must be included in further PM lock analysis; it cannot be treated as a plain allocation. The matching public [XNU IOServicePM implementation](https://github.com/apple-oss-distributions/xnu/blob/xnu-11417.140.69/iokit/Kernel/IOServicePM.cpp) submits power-driver registration as an asynchronous request; PMstop inhibits new driver callbacks and waits for prior driver callbacks before asynchronous power-plane detach. This is evidence about those operations, not proof that every call made during interface construction is nonblocking. Targeted disassembly is retained locally; Apple binaries are not redistributed.

Shutdown now uses the same power-event barrier before the base controller shutdown callback, so a queued probe cannot boot firmware after shutdown quiescence. This path is covered by an ordering guard and the existing DeviceOff power-method tests; physical shutdown remains untested.


### Native admission and security lifetime across power transitions (2026-10-28)

Native requests now check the atomic power I/O block both before waiting for the radio gate and inside that gate. This closes the interval where a request passed the initial check but entered after a sleep/off caller raised the block. The event bridge does not run radio/crypto progress or publish join success while power is blocked and WMI is still active. Once the power action has quiesced WMI, the bridge still delivers pending terminal scan/join/link events; blocking those would leave system transactions unfinished.

A radio-gated `discardNativeSecurity()` resets the supplicant (including PMK/PTK/replay state), pending reply/key buffers and the retained join key without discarding nonsecret association-event metadata. Runtime end, native worker stop and radio-off call it directly. Radio-side cancel/failure/disconnect cleanup also drops a live security context before notification delivery. Thus a failed PostOffice allocation cannot retain software credentials until Deauth/LinkDown eventually succeeds. DMA-owned connection/command buffers retain their existing hardware-quiescence ordering; this helper does not write into them.

Portable tests execute the exact production dispatcher/action and the gated admission prefix with a gate-entry power/stop/runtime transition seam. They count acceptance, not firmware side effects, across scan, associate, MAC and power-query requests. The bridge test executes its production methods to prove that pending-suspend work is suppressed while inactive-runtime terminal delivery remains available. A separate test executes the production NativeSecurity class and discard method: it initializes a fixture PMK/nonce, dirties pending key/reply buffers, and verifies byte-for-byte supplicant reset and buffer wiping while retaining the BSSID/event metadata. Source guards check call sites; those guards do not execute a kernel stop. Full host suite, sanitizers and native build are required before packaging. This remains an offline candidate, not hardware validation or automatic wake recovery.

Additional local teardown evidence: IO80211Controller::detachInterface (ffffff8002227be8) validates the object and clears its primary-interface pointer; its analyzed body does not itself stop the interface. IO80211SkywalkInterface::stop (ffffff8002264772) includes PM-stop dispatch and resource cleanup, and IOSkywalkNetworkInterface::stop (ffffff8002980b2e) calls deregisterNetworkInterface before the base stop. These entry points are from the image UUIDs above. Their whole transitive call graphs and asynchronous teardown still require review; no full absence-of-deadlock claim follows from these three bodies.


### Pending suspend intent cannot become restart readiness (2026-10-28)

A second suspend could raise the atomic block to 1 while an older DeviceOn/wake action still held the initialization/radio gate. The older action, with `needsRestart` from the first sleep, could then promote that same 1 to 2 and temporarily advertise clean-restart readiness before the new suspend recorded its root/device state. Native traffic stayed blocked, but a recovery caller could mistake this for a valid restart window.

The atomic word now combines phase (low two bits) and pending-suspend count (upper bits). Queueing a root/device suspend increments that count and blocks I/O in one compare-and-swap. The gated suspend action consumes one count only after recording its root/device state. Wake can promote exactly 1 to 2; a pending count changes the word and prevents that CAS from succeeding. Saturation is fail-closed, not a wrap to active. Existing `powerIOBlocked` and `powerRestartAllowed` accept only exact 0 and 2 respectively. This is a prerequisite for automatic recovery, not its implementation.

The production power-method test holds the initialization barrier as an older DeviceOn would, starts simultaneous root-sleep and device-off threads, verifies both pending intents, executes the older gated DeviceOn, and checks that neither pending intent nor I/O blocking/restart exclusion was lost. After both suspend actions finish, root/device wake must both be recorded before readiness returns. Earlier power, partial-DMA and notification tests remain enabled.

Wake-recovery design constraint: the local SDK `getPowerState` documentation explicitly says that a power parent's current state can remain the off-state while its child is being powered up. A polling check of PCI `getPowerState()` is therefore not the recovery readiness contract. The implementation must rely on device/root power callbacks and their queued intent. Before enabling automatic terminate/rematch, move controller PM setup before initial firmware scheduling, queue the first probe only when the new instance is permitted on, and handle callbacks arriving during registration. A fresh rematched instance must also obey parent DeviceOff even if it missed an earlier root sleep notification. The recovery worker must run outside WCL/radio/initialization gates and PM callouts, own retained lifetime references, and transfer its cancellation ownership before termination so stop cannot wait for its own callback. New pending sleep must invalidate readiness; old DMA rings and keys must never be rearmed. These integration steps and their kernel/hardware validation remain incomplete.


### Registration allocation ownership and inherited cleanup (2026-10-28)

The previous bridge allocated two generic IOMalloc(0x130) buffers and placed them in framework-owned registration slots. Matching IOSkywalkFamily assembly shows a different contract: Network registration copies a 0x108 prefix using IOMallocTypeImpl; Ethernet copyRegistrationInfo copies 0x130 with its own typed allocation; Network deregistration and Ethernet destruction use IOFreeTypeImpl. The linked kernel identifies those calls, while IOMalloc_external uses KHEAP_DEFAULT/kalloc_ext. This is an allocator/type/size mismatch in the old implementation; its causal connection to the recorded hardware freeze has not been proven.

The bridge now calls the stock nonvirtual IOSkywalkEthernetInterface::copyRegistrationInfo factory. The Ethernet slot owns that single allocation, including partial factory failure after MAC property publication fails. The Network slot temporarily borrows its common 0x108 prefix. stop(), free() and virtual deregisterLogicalLink() detach only that loan before the inherited cleanup executes; another owner's slot is left for its own cleanup. The Ethernet owner survives stop/deregistration and releases the buffer in final base free, so a reader which already obtained the prefix does not lose storage at detach. There is no generic allocation handed to a typed free, and no second owner of the same pointer. Preexisting registrations reject setup rather than being overwritten. The bridge does not call the full Nexus/logical-link registration method with fabricated packet pools or null links.

The local macOS15 Network RegistrationInfo declaration is corrected to 0x108, the Ethernet factory signature is added as IOReturn, and these deviations from the pinned vendor snapshot are recorded in vendor/itlwm/SOURCE.json. Static assertions retain the existing class layouts and verify both registration sizes. The stock addresses are Network registration ffffff8002980ebc, Ethernet factory ffffff8002986fec, Network deregistration ffffff8002980b64, Ethernet free ffffff8002986e5a, and virtual deregisterLogicalLink ffffff800298115e. Direct deregistration references identified in the analyzed families belong to base stop/free, virtual deregisterLogicalLink and full Ethernet registration failure cleanup. The latter registration entry is not called by this bridge.

Compiled parent dispatch was checked against the actual IO80211InfraProtocol vtable: offset 0xa0 resolves to IO80211InfraInterface::free (ffffff80022d3ae0), 0x5d8 to IO80211InfraInterface::stop (ffffff80022d3a04), and 0x8e8 to IOSkywalkNetworkInterface::deregisterLogicalLink (ffffff800298115e). That verifies the three inherited calls added here, not all framework vtables. Native compilation, signature verification and offline kernel linking confirm that the factory import is resolvable on the installed system.

Portable tests execute the exact production setup/detach/stop/free/deregister methods with a typed-owner seam that rejects freeing the Ethernet object as Network memory. Coverage includes success, stop then destruction, destruction without stop, virtual deregistration and error forwarding, repeat detachment, factory failure before allocation and after allocation, missing factory output/expansion, preexisting owners and a replacement Network owner. A saved reader is checked while the Ethernet owner is still alive after stop/deregister. The mock base is intentionally repeatable; these tests do not establish that every stock stop routine is idempotent, nor execute the kernel's typed allocator. Hardware teardown and the full asynchronous framework lifecycle remain to be verified.

Address normalization correction: the matching standalone kernel and the kernel embedded in BootKernelExtensions.kc share UUID E999BA1A-CC26-3685-A2DB-AB7085F6F12A but have different VM header bases (ffffff8000200000 versus ffffff80002e8000). Cross-image call targets must use linked-cache symbols; for example IOMallocTypeImpl is ffffff8000ab6770 and IOFreeTypeImpl is ffffff8000ab68a0 there. Standalone kernel function-body analysis and image-relative stackshot symbolization remain valid when normalized to the standalone image. Mixing standalone VM symbols with cache cross-image targets is invalid. No Apple binary or disassembly is redistributed with the source or package.
