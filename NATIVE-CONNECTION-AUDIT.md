# Native connection audit (2026-10-28)

Hardware-confirmed: firmware starts, macOS creates en1 and shows scanned networks.
Association/data traffic are not yet confirmed. WCLJoinManager was observed aborting
on unsupported WCL_LOW_LATENCY_INFO before dispatching the association callback.

This revision answers that query with the actual zero session mask, applies scan
away-time settings, keeps a bounded 30-second candidate cache, and adds PSK-SHA256
(AKM 6, descriptor 3) without changing a requested AKM to PSK/SHA1. Required PMF,
SAE and enterprise authentication remain explicitly unsupported. Optional offloads
are not falsely marked implemented.

The next hardware run confirmed LOW_LATENCY_INFO no longer blocks the attempt.
WCL now aborts on SET_MAC_ADDRESS before association dispatch. This revision adds
disconnected station MAC changes through VDEV_DELETE, ECHO, VDEV_CREATE with the
requested address, and a second distinct ECHO. Publication to BSD and the native
address query happens only after both firmware barriers. Invalid/multicast/zero
addresses are rejected; an active link, outstanding scan/DMA, or another address
request returns busy. The WCL caller sleeps with the network gate released;
runtime commands are isolated during the transaction. A five-second transaction
limit and six-second caller deadline stop/reset the radio on failure instead of
claiming an address change. This does not implement MAC rotation on an active link.
The final connection-stage BSS lookup now also uses the fresh candidate cache.

Host tests cover native wire layouts, association RSN, cache freshness, regulatory
bounds, SHA1 legacy behavior and independent SHA256 four-way/rekey fixtures. SHA256
fixtures use hashlib plus cryptography; regenerating them requires
`tests/requirements-fixtures.txt`. The committed fixtures use only public test keys.
The macOS SHA256 test uses CommonCrypto, while the kernel uses corecrypto. Hardware
validation, DHCP and live traffic are still necessary.

Current adapter and private ABI: pinned upstream in vendor/itlwm/SOURCE.json.

WPA3-Personal (SAE plus mandatory PMF/BIP) is a required next development target.
PSK-SHA256 support must not be described as WPA3.

AWDL and AirDrop are explicit planned features; they require a separate AWDL
interface/data path and Bluetooth integration, not only AP connectivity.

MAC host tests execute the production runtime method with mocked DMA/MMIO seams,
including both barriers, wrong ECHO cookies, pending credits/DMA, timeout,
invalid ring state, sync failure and BSD publication failure. These tests do not
prove that QCA9377 firmware accepts a live delete/recreate cycle; hardware
verification is still required. Firmware command reference:

## First association and post-association watchdog (2026-10-28)

The e2b8293 hardware run confirmed station MAC recreation, association on DFS
channel 52, completed PSK-SHA256 protection, DHCP IPv4, IPv6 configuration and
bidirectional traffic on the native interface. This is a functional milestone,
not a stability claim: a subsequent system watchdog captured a lock cycle.

The 03:08:31 configd stackshot records kernel threads 345 and 13561 waiting for
mutexes owned by each other. Symbolication against the matching stock
IO80211Family UUID identifies setLQM + 0x49 in the radio-side thread and
reportDataPathEvents + 0x69, InfraInterface::postMessage and
PostOffice::outForDelivery in the WCL-side thread. configd's IP configuration
queue waits on the same cycle. No new kernel panic is required for this failure.

The fix removes synchronous LQM/link-state calls from the radio worker and
moves native service into one coalesced thread call. It enters the WCL gate,
then the network/radio gate. PostOffice enqueue/delivery and native requests now
use WCL -> network ordering. The runtime timer only schedules work and never
waits for WCL. Reset/availability/join-abort notifications are routed through
the same bridge. The queued callback uses THREAD_CALL_OPTIONS_ONCE, so
invocations cannot execute concurrently. Stop marks requests stopped under the
network gate, releases that gate, cancels/waits and frees the callback, then
releases interfaces/radio resources. MAC firmware progress stays on the radio
timer, allowing a WCL MAC callback to sleep without blocking its completion.

Host regressions execute the production bridge callbacks with mocked gates and
verify ordering, coalescing, inactive/stopped behavior and cancellation outside
gates. Architecture guards reject synchronous WCL interface updates in the
radio worker and direct PostOffice use outside the bridge. Hardware stability
of this correction is not yet confirmed. Continue auditing reconnect, scans
while associated, IP/multicast handling, key renewal, shutdown and sleep/wake;
do not treat host tests as proof for those scenarios.

Thread-call cancellation/ONCE semantics checked against Apple's Sequoia-era XNU:
https://github.com/apple-oss-distributions/xnu/blob/xnu-11417.140.69/osfmk/kern/thread_call.c

Startup guard: do not schedule the WCL bridge until the native protocol has
started and BSD binding has requested readiness. This prevents the new bridge
from overlapping the initial synchronous BSD/WCL binding in the opposite order.

Runtime-failure audit: after IRQ/DMA quiescence, a pending native scan is marked
failed/completed and a terminal WCL service is queued even with the radio timer
stopped. The bridge permits this inactive-radio failure notification when a
scan/join/link needs completion, while suppressing new availability announcements.
MAC failure wakeups schedule terminal delivery after releasing their wait state.


## Repeated watchdog and normal-mode overhead (2026-10-28)

The next hardware run still hung. A second configd watchdog at 03:44:08
shows a different cycle: IOServiceTerminateThread (111), in
IO80211APIUserClient::stop +0x125, and thread-call worker 17044, in nested
IOCommandGate::runAction. WCLTimerSource::serialAction and CCLogPipe are also
blocked behind it. Matching kernel and IO80211 UUIDs were checked locally;
raw reports are deliberately excluded because they contain private process data.
This rules out treating the previous queue order as a complete stability fix.

The native notification bridge now attempts both gates without waiting.
Contention retains the coalesced pending notification and schedules one delayed
retry after 10 ms; it never waits for the network gate while holding WCL.
This removes that blocking edge even when an Apple user-client termination
holds the network workloop and waits for WCL. Production-method host tests cover
contention at either gate, delayed retry, successful delivery and stop ordering.
The stackshot alone does not establish that every observed disconnect has this
cause; repeat hardware verification is required.

Normal builds now omit 220 detailed bring-up/event console messages while
keeping error/rejection/quarantine messages. Build with DIAGNOSTICS=1 to restore
them and the idle whole-pool DMA audit. Per-packet ownership, DMA sync, refill and
completion checks remain enabled. The full idle audit walked 1023 mappings once
per second; it is diagnostic work rather than a prerequisite for packet delivery.
Neither boot-time improvement nor stable reconnection has yet been measured on
this candidate. WPA3/PMF, Tahoe, AWDL and AirDrop remain incomplete.


## Post-1333 hardware run: background scan disconnect (2026-10-28)

The quieter nonblocking candidate booted; the user reports visibly faster system
startup and no new configd watchdog was present during this short observation.
This is not a stability pass: two driver disconnects were recorded. At 04:16:47
WCL explicitly logged GET WCL_BSS_INFO (433) returning NotReady, updateBss failing,
and an involuntary leave with reason Update Bss fail. Scan completion had cleared
_nativeBSSBytes after using the same scratch buffer for unrelated BSS records.

The current-BSS query now rebuilds its reply from the associated connection AP
while connected, independently of scan buffer lifetime. Visible beacon SSID IEs
are passed without an unnecessary metadata SSID override; a hidden advertisement
keeps the override path. The connection hiddenSSID flag now follows the selected
AP instead of remaining unconditionally true. UI hidden-network classification
still needs verification after reboot; a previously saved hidden flag can persist.

Measured timeline: kernel boot 04:13:29, interface named 04:13:54, user autojoin
04:15:02, link active 04:15:33.876, DHCP BOUND 04:15:34.939. The pre-login interval
must not be attributed entirely to driver connection latency. About 32 seconds
remain between user autojoin and DHCP; repeated scan failures were observed.
Scan requests still collect the full regulatory plan before filtering requested
channels, so optimizing directed/subset scans remains open. No router change is
required. A 45-packet source-bound gateway test had zero loss (average 3.77 ms),
and interface-bound direct HTTPS succeeded. An earlier bound-interface ping
returned routing errors and is not a driver packet-loss measurement.


## API user-client provider workloop (2026-10-28)

7a17e7f still hung, with no usable DHCP address before the stall. At 04:30:37
configd's watchdog captured IOServiceTerminateThread 111 holding the inherited
controller workloop while waiting in IO80211APIUserClient::stop. Airportd thread
8587 held WCL and waited on a command gate in apple80211RouteExternal. CCLogPipe,
network ioctl and WCL timer threads queued behind these owners. Kernel UUID and
IO80211 symbols match the captured report. The report includes threads from all
processes: the owner 8587 is in airportd, not kernel pid 0.

Ath10kNativeInterface now overrides getWorkLoop to return the WCL workqueue.
IOService's documented provider-chain workloop inheritance otherwise reaches
Ath10kPCIDevice::getWorkLoop, which intentionally returns the separate threaded
BSD/radio workloop. API user-client termination must serialize on WCL itself;
it must not hold the radio gate while entering WCL. The controller keeps its
thread-backed network workloop and the existing nonblocking notification bridge.
Host contract tests enforce both sides of this separation. Hardware verification
is still required and the observed stall is not attributed to WPA keys solely
because the exposed port-authorized property stayed true.

The saved macOS known-network profile also contains Hidden=true for the tested
visible AP. This is separate from current beacon parsing and has not been edited
or deleted. Current-BSS scratch-lifetime fix is retained. Visible-network UI and
usable traffic remain pending; zero disconnects on a stalled driver is not a
stability pass. No manual kext load or further reboot was performed.

The attached BSD interface presents the Wi-Fi protocol as its provider. It therefore also overrides getWorkLoop explicitly, in the opposite direction: it retains the controller network workloop for Ethernet operations. This prevents the Wi-Fi provider correction from accidentally moving BSD operations onto a threadless WCL queue. Both provider-chain endpoints are checked.


## Requested-channel scan contract (2026-10-28)

Native channel subsets now restrict firmware START_SCAN itself, intersecting the physical channel plan and regulatory policy. Unknown/6 GHz channels cannot turn into unrestricted scans; an empty intersection fails before submission. An accepted request cancelled before the first firmware submission completes locally without START/STOP or DMA ownership. Legacy full-plan wire format and passive DFS behavior remain unchanged. Native decode-to-command fixtures, extracted production provider getters, ASan/UBSan and mocked radio cancellation/credit/event regressions cover these changes. Hardware autojoin timing remains unverified. Event enqueue errors discovered in matching PostOffice assembly are tracked as an open P0 task in NATIVE-CONTRACT.md.


## Checked event acceptance and rekey continuity (2026-10-28)

The notification emitter now checks PostOffice enqueue results. It retains
accepted-prefix markers/cursors and retries a failed suffix through the
coalesced ONCE worker after 10 ms. ScanDone and ConnectComplete are not marked
sent on allocation failure. Disconnect events preserve the old BSSID across
radio cleanup, and pending terminal notifications block incompatible new
transactions. Real associated beacon data remains queryable even if the
FirstBeacon message is still waiting for memory. Supplicant progress runs
before notification attempts.

The same production-emitter tests found and cover false link-down during
legitimate key replacement and the contradictory success/failure outcome at a
join deadline. Deadline failure now wins and performs data-port/crypto cleanup
once even if its notification must retry. Hardware validation is pending; these
source-level corrections are not a claim that all prior hangs are resolved.


### Control-worker teardown ordering (2026-10-28)

The deferred probe can create the native interface and service thread call while cancellation waits for it. Both stop() and partial-initialization free() now drain that producer first, then stop/drain native requests, before releasing power notifications, runtime, IRQ or DMA resources. This closes late-worker creation after cancellation and access to already released radio resources. A host test executes the production drain helper with an in-flight producer; source guards check both resource-release call sites. Full host tests, ASan/UBSan and the native build pass. This is an offline candidate, not a verified fix for the observed hardware freeze.

Wake remains incomplete: the current power path blocks I/O after wake pending a full restart, and sleep notification registration happens after deferred firmware initialization. Automatic native recovery must coordinate in-progress initialization, sleep acknowledgement, DMA quiescence and provider rematch; simply clearing the block or replaying notifications is unsafe. No automatic recovery is claimed here.


### Sleep during initialization: barrier and ordering (2026-10-28)

This candidate supersedes the late-notifier-registration gap described above. The priority root sleep notifier is now registered before the deferred firmware/DMA producer is queued. A dedicated initialization mutex covers firmware probing and interface construction. The sleep/off path first raises the atomic I/O block, then waits for this producer barrier, and only then enters the radio workloop to quiesce the device. A producer which starts after the block is raised exits without booting firmware. Before WMI has a workloop, the power action uses the already-created controller workloop. Controller PM registration runs after releasing the initialization barrier, and runtime timer/IRQ startup rejects a pending power block. The mutex remains alive through base-controller destruction, after notifier removal, PMstop and worker draining.

The first suspend verifies bootstrap/runtime DMA release even when WMI never became active, retaining quarantine on failure. Repeated root/device suspend notices do not repeat PCI accesses after the first quiescence. DeviceOn or unsolicited wake before the pending suspend action records its state must not clear the atomic block: that case remains `suspend-pending`. An ordinary wake following a recorded suspend still requires a clean restart; automatic rematch is not implemented by this change.

Host tests execute the production power methods with real host threads and a mutex: a sleep callback raises the I/O block immediately, cannot acknowledge while initialization owns the barrier, and acknowledges after the producer leaves and the fallback controller gate verifies DMA. They also cover pending-suspend/DeviceOn ordering, partial-bootstrap quarantine, repeated notices, device/root wake ordering and cancelled sleep. Initialization and destruction boundaries are source guards, not an execution of the full kernel firmware probe. Physical sleep and freedom from all framework lock cycles remain unverified.

Framework evidence: the installed IO80211Family `IO80211SkywalkInterface::start` (UUID 0D5AC570-04D4-38B6-8577-9F21350CDD50, entry ffffff80022616d6) performs interface PM setup at ffffff8002261bb0–ffffff8002261bfa. Therefore interface construction itself must be included in further PM lock analysis; it cannot be treated as a plain allocation. The matching public [XNU IOServicePM implementation](https://github.com/apple-oss-distributions/xnu/blob/xnu-11417.140.69/iokit/Kernel/IOServicePM.cpp) submits power-driver registration as an asynchronous request; PMstop inhibits new driver callbacks and waits for prior driver callbacks before asynchronous power-plane detach. This is evidence about those operations, not proof that every call made during interface construction is nonblocking. Targeted disassembly is retained locally; Apple binaries are not redistributed.

Shutdown now uses the same power-event barrier before the base controller shutdown callback, so a queued probe cannot boot firmware after shutdown quiescence. This path is covered by an ordering guard and the existing DeviceOff power-method tests; physical shutdown remains untested.


### Native admission and security lifetime across power transitions (2026-10-28)

Native requests now check the atomic power I/O block both before waiting for the radio gate and inside that gate. This closes the interval where a request passed the initial check but entered after a sleep/off caller raised the block. The event bridge does not run radio/crypto progress or publish join success while power is blocked and WMI is still active. Once the power action has quiesced WMI, the bridge still delivers pending terminal scan/join/link events; blocking those would leave system transactions unfinished.

A radio-gated `discardNativeSecurity()` resets the supplicant (including PMK/PTK/replay state), pending reply/key buffers and the retained join key without discarding nonsecret association-event metadata. Runtime end, native worker stop and radio-off call it directly. Radio-side cancel/failure/disconnect cleanup also drops a live security context before notification delivery. Thus a failed PostOffice allocation cannot retain software credentials until Deauth/LinkDown eventually succeeds. DMA-owned connection/command buffers retain their existing hardware-quiescence ordering; this helper does not write into them.

Portable tests execute the exact production dispatcher/action and the gated admission prefix with a gate-entry power/stop/runtime transition seam. They count acceptance, not firmware side effects, across scan, associate, MAC and power-query requests. The bridge test executes its production methods to prove that pending-suspend work is suppressed while inactive-runtime terminal delivery remains available. A separate test executes the production NativeSecurity class and discard method: it initializes a fixture PMK/nonce, dirties pending key/reply buffers, and verifies byte-for-byte supplicant reset and buffer wiping while retaining the BSSID/event metadata. Source guards check call sites; those guards do not execute a kernel stop. Full host suite, sanitizers and native build are required before packaging. This remains an offline candidate, not hardware validation or automatic wake recovery.

Additional local teardown evidence: IO80211Controller::detachInterface (ffffff8002227be8) validates the object and clears its primary-interface pointer; its analyzed body does not itself stop the interface. IO80211SkywalkInterface::stop (ffffff8002264772) includes PM-stop dispatch and resource cleanup, and IOSkywalkNetworkInterface::stop (ffffff8002980b2e) calls deregisterNetworkInterface before the base stop. These entry points are from the image UUIDs above. Their whole transitive call graphs and asynchronous teardown still require review; no full absence-of-deadlock claim follows from these three bodies.


### Pending suspend intent cannot become restart readiness (2026-10-28)

A second suspend could raise the atomic block to 1 while an older DeviceOn/wake action still held the initialization/radio gate. The older action, with `needsRestart` from the first sleep, could then promote that same 1 to 2 and temporarily advertise clean-restart readiness before the new suspend recorded its root/device state. Native traffic stayed blocked, but a recovery caller could mistake this for a valid restart window.

The atomic word now combines phase (low two bits) and pending-suspend count (upper bits). Queueing a root/device suspend increments that count and blocks I/O in one compare-and-swap. The gated suspend action consumes one count only after recording its root/device state. Wake can promote exactly 1 to 2; a pending count changes the word and prevents that CAS from succeeding. Saturation is fail-closed, not a wrap to active. Existing `powerIOBlocked` and `powerRestartAllowed` accept only exact 0 and 2 respectively. This is a prerequisite for automatic recovery, not its implementation.

The production power-method test holds the initialization barrier as an older DeviceOn would, starts simultaneous root-sleep and device-off threads, verifies both pending intents, executes the older gated DeviceOn, and checks that neither pending intent nor I/O blocking/restart exclusion was lost. After both suspend actions finish, root/device wake must both be recorded before readiness returns. Earlier power, partial-DMA and notification tests remain enabled.

Wake-recovery design constraint: the local SDK `getPowerState` documentation explicitly says that a power parent's current state can remain the off-state while its child is being powered up. A polling check of PCI `getPowerState()` is therefore not the recovery readiness contract. The implementation must rely on device/root power callbacks and their queued intent. Before enabling automatic terminate/rematch, move controller PM setup before initial firmware scheduling, queue the first probe only when the new instance is permitted on, and handle callbacks arriving during registration. A fresh rematched instance must also obey parent DeviceOff even if it missed an earlier root sleep notification. The recovery worker must run outside WCL/radio/initialization gates and PM callouts, own retained lifetime references, and transfer its cancellation ownership before termination so stop cannot wait for its own callback. New pending sleep must invalidate readiness; old DMA rings and keys must never be rearmed. These integration steps and their kernel/hardware validation remain incomplete.


### Registration allocation ownership and inherited cleanup (2026-10-28)

The previous bridge allocated two generic IOMalloc(0x130) buffers and placed them in framework-owned registration slots. Matching IOSkywalkFamily assembly shows a different contract: Network registration copies a 0x108 prefix using IOMallocTypeImpl; Ethernet copyRegistrationInfo copies 0x130 with its own typed allocation; Network deregistration and Ethernet destruction use IOFreeTypeImpl. The linked kernel identifies those calls, while IOMalloc_external uses KHEAP_DEFAULT/kalloc_ext. This is an allocator/type/size mismatch in the old implementation; its causal connection to the recorded hardware freeze has not been proven.

The bridge now calls the stock nonvirtual IOSkywalkEthernetInterface::copyRegistrationInfo factory. The Ethernet slot owns that single allocation, including partial factory failure after MAC property publication fails. The Network slot temporarily borrows its common 0x108 prefix. stop(), free() and virtual deregisterLogicalLink() detach only that loan before the inherited cleanup executes; another owner's slot is left for its own cleanup. The Ethernet owner survives stop/deregistration and releases the buffer in final base free, so a reader which already obtained the prefix does not lose storage at detach. There is no generic allocation handed to a typed free, and no second owner of the same pointer. Preexisting registrations reject setup rather than being overwritten. The bridge does not call the full Nexus/logical-link registration method with fabricated packet pools or null links.

The local macOS15 Network RegistrationInfo declaration is corrected to 0x108, the Ethernet factory signature is added as IOReturn, and these deviations from the pinned vendor snapshot are recorded in vendor/itlwm/SOURCE.json. Static assertions retain the existing class layouts and verify both registration sizes. The stock addresses are Network registration ffffff8002980ebc, Ethernet factory ffffff8002986fec, Network deregistration ffffff8002980b64, Ethernet free ffffff8002986e5a, and virtual deregisterLogicalLink ffffff800298115e. Direct deregistration references identified in the analyzed families belong to base stop/free, virtual deregisterLogicalLink and full Ethernet registration failure cleanup. The latter registration entry is not called by this bridge.

Compiled parent dispatch was checked against the actual IO80211InfraProtocol vtable: offset 0xa0 resolves to IO80211InfraInterface::free (ffffff80022d3ae0), 0x5d8 to IO80211InfraInterface::stop (ffffff80022d3a04), and 0x8e8 to IOSkywalkNetworkInterface::deregisterLogicalLink (ffffff800298115e). That verifies the three inherited calls added here, not all framework vtables. Native compilation, signature verification and offline kernel linking confirm that the factory import is resolvable on the installed system.

Portable tests execute the exact production setup/detach/stop/free/deregister methods with a typed-owner seam that rejects freeing the Ethernet object as Network memory. Coverage includes success, stop then destruction, destruction without stop, virtual deregistration and error forwarding, repeat detachment, factory failure before allocation and after allocation, missing factory output/expansion, preexisting owners and a replacement Network owner. A saved reader is checked while the Ethernet owner is still alive after stop/deregister. The mock base is intentionally repeatable; these tests do not establish that every stock stop routine is idempotent, nor execute the kernel's typed allocator. Hardware teardown and the full asynchronous framework lifecycle remain to be verified.

Address normalization correction: the matching standalone kernel and the kernel embedded in BootKernelExtensions.kc share UUID E999BA1A-CC26-3685-A2DB-AB7085F6F12A but have different VM header bases (ffffff8000200000 versus ffffff80002e8000). Cross-image call targets must use linked-cache symbols; for example IOMallocTypeImpl is ffffff8000ab6770 and IOFreeTypeImpl is ffffff8000ab68a0 there. Standalone kernel function-body analysis and image-relative stackshot symbolization remain valid when normalized to the standalone image. Mixing standalone VM symbols with cache cross-image targets is invalid. No Apple binary or disassembly is redistributed with the source or package.


### Leaf interface stop precedes controller cleanup (2026-10-28)

The matching [XNU IOService implementation](https://github.com/apple-oss-distributions/xnu/blob/xnu-11417.140.69/iokit/Kernel/IOService.cpp) defers a terminated service's stop until its leaf clients are finalized, invokes client stop on the provider workloop, and then detaches it. The driver's cached `_nativeStarted`/`_nativeAttached` flags could therefore remain true even after the framework had already stopped and detached the native interface. Controller cleanup previously called stop/detach again unconditionally from those flags. It now checks that the native interface still names this controller as its provider before performing the manual fallback. Controller-primary bookkeeping and the driver's retained reference are still released.

There was also a lifetime interval between framework interface stop and later controller stop where the native event worker could still address the interface's managers. Ath10kNativeInterface::stop now retires the matching controller-side protocol before detaching registration metadata or invoking inherited stop. A radio-gated action marks native requests stopped, clears `_nativeStarted`, wipes pending software security and ends WMI runtime. Already accepted WCL/radio work completes before that action takes the radio gate; later requests and event callbacks cannot use the retired interface. Identity checking prevents an unrelated interface from stopping the current one. The stop hook does not cancel/wait for the service thread while IOService may hold the radio gate. Controller stop/free later perform the existing outside-gate drain. Interface construction installs the native gate before creating the interface; a gate-less partial teardown only marks protocol state and avoids hardware calls.

The production controller-release method is executed with framework-already-stopped/detached, manually owned started, attached-but-unstarted, unattached partial, foreign-provider and repeated-cleanup states. The seam rejects a second child stop. It verifies BSD detachment first, retained references/security release and interface release before gate removal. Bridge tests execute the production leaf-stop hook to check radio-gated retirement without thread-call waits, suppression of subsequent services, deferred controller drain, identity rejection and the partial fallback. Registration tests execute the production interface stop wrapper including its controller hook. These are host lifetime/ordering seams, not execution of XNU's termination worker or proof that every stock stop routine is idempotent.

Remaining PM stop audit: stock IO80211InfraInterface::setPowerState (ffffff80022dbfe8) synchronously enters its WCL queue through IOWorkLoop::runActionBlock (linked kernel ffffff8000afb580); stock IO80211SkywalkInterface::stop calls PMstop. XNU PMstop waits for outstanding driver callouts. Native leaf stop can run under its controller/provider radio loop, so PM callout/WCL/radio ordering must be resolved before automatic terminate/rematch is enabled. This candidate does not yet implement that deferred PM-callout drain or automatic wake recovery. IOSkywalkInterface::didTerminate (ffffff8002973036) delegates through the base termination callbacks rather than providing such a PM drain.
